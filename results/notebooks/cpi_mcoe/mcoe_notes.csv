Notes on marginal cost of electricity (MCOE) calculations using EIA860 and EIA923 data
Years in EIA analysis: 2011-2016
Years in FERC analysis: 2004-2016
Since 2016 data is availble for EIA923 but not EIA860 we have used the 2015 capacities listed in EIA860 to calculate the 2016 capacity factors
Plants with nameplate_capacity < 10 MW are excluded
Heat_rate_mmbtu_mwh < 5.0 are excluded (replaced with NA)
Capacity_factor < 0 are excluded
Capacity_factor >= 1.5 are excluded
Net_generation_mwh < 0 are retained to account for generators where parasitic load is greater than annual net generation
mcoe_by_generator file includes only plants defined as ‘simple’ - they have PUDL plant IDs which map to a single FERC plant
Because FERC data is only available at the plant level all FERC data is redundant across rows when a plant has more than one generator associated with it in the EIA data.
