- When pulling f1_fuel (2015 data) into the postgres database for the first
  time, discovered that respondent_id=454 exists in the f1_fuel table, but
  doesn't exist in the f1_respondent_id table.  This violates the
  ForeignKeyConstraint that we have implemented... and means we don't know what
  utility corresponds to respondent_id=454.  Based on the plants listed in
  f1_fuel, it appears to be an Entergy company.

- Looking at the historical F1_1.DBF files, it seems that new respondent_id's
  were last added between 2013 and 2014, and previously between 2004 and 2005.
  They don't seem to get added/updated very often.  Seems suspicious that they
  would only update once a decade, and then mysteriously in that update, a
  bunch of new utilities appear.  It seems like there's maybe a lag in their
  updating of the utilities in the list, at least in the public version of the
  DB?

- Here's how the set of respondent_ids has changed over time, 1994 to 2015:
  ids added between 1997 and 1998: {305, 306, 307, 308, 309}
  ids removed between 1998 and 1999: {305, 306, 307, 308, 309}
  ids added between 1999 and 2000: {320, 433, 432, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319}
  ids removed between 2000 and 2001: {320, 432, 433, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319}
  ids removed between 2001 and 2002: {305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310}
  ids added between 2002 and 2003: {305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310}
  ids added between 2004 and 2005: {444, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 311, 312, 313, 314, 320, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 445, 446}
  ids added between 2013 and 2014: {448, 321, 450, 451, 449, 452, 453, 447}

- f1_row_lit_tbl: primary key definition is wrong... non-unique values.
- f1_s0_filing_log: primary key definition is wrong... non-unique values.
